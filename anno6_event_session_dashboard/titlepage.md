#### __Summary Information for Event Sessions in Anno 2205__


#### Usage
* Unfortunately, as with some of the other dashboards, the amount of data has grown too large to by able to dynamically query for new data. As a result the dashboard has shifted to using static weekly updates. The Date Range now shows the data currently available. Filtering within this available data still works.
* __Date Range__ - Select required range of dates to filter data. This will filter to corporations whose creation was within the dates selected.
* __Corporation Level Range__ - Select a range of levels to filter event session data.
* __Load Data__ - Click the red button to load data. If any changes are mode to Date Range or Level Range the button must be clicked again for them to take effect.

#### Charts
* __Events Played and Playtime__ - Contains a selection of charts displaying the number of event session played and how long it takes to complete them
* __Rare Material Rewards__ - Shows where most rare materials come from and how much of each users gain during each event session
* __Special Actions__ - How many times users use different special actions and which are used most often
* __Military Level__ - Average military level of corporations based on corporation level

#### Data
* __Raw Data__ - A table containing the raw Event Session data
* __Summary Data__ - Summary data used to produce charts and downloadable Excel sheet
* __Pivot Table__ - A simple pivot table for prototyping summaries (Pivot table has been removed due to the large amount of data after launch)
